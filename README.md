### `npm test`

Launches Jest <br>

👩🏻‍💻 Developer Ready: A comprehensive JavaScript testing solution. Works out of the box for most JavaScript projects.

🏃🏽 Instant Feedback: Fast, interactive watch mode only runs test files related to changed files.

📸 Snapshot Testing: Capture snapshots of large objects to simplify testing and to analyze how they change over time.

See more [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).

Besides **Jest**, this project uses also **Enzyme** a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.
